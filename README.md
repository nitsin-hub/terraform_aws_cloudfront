# Content Delivery Network (CDN) Implementation Using Cloud Front & Terraform
I have done a task for automatic deployment of a static website to Apache web-server through Content Delivery Network (CDN) using cloud Front service of AWS. I have created a script 'cloudfront_web_deployment.tf' that is used to create complete infrastructure in AWS cloud for deploying a simple static website using CloudFront.
